# LoopBack Boot

**⚠️ LoopBack 3 has reached end of life. We are no longer accepting pull requests or providing 
support for community users. The only exception is fixes for critical bugs and security 
vulnerabilities provided as part of support for IBM API Connect customers. (See
[Module Long Term Support Policy](#module-long-term-support-policy) below.)**

We urge all LoopBack 3 users to migrate their applications to LoopBack 4 as
soon as possible. Refer to our
[Migration Guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/migration-overview.html)
for more information on how to upgrade.

## Overview

A convention-based bootstrapper for LoopBack applications.

For full documentation, see the official StrongLoop documentation: [Defining boot scripts](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Defining-boot-scripts) and [Creating a LoopBack application](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Creating-an-application).

The loopback-boot module initializes (bootstraps) a LoopBack application.  Specifically, it:
 - Configures data-sources.
 - Defines custom models
 - Configures models and attaches models to data-sources.
 - Configures application settings
 - Runs additional boot scripts, so you can put custom setup code in multiple small files instead of in the main application file.

For more information, see [Defining boot scripts](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Defining-boot-scripts).

### Version notes

The version range `1.x` is backwards compatible with `app.boot` provided
by LoopBack 1.x versions and the project layout scaffolded by `slc lb project`
up to slc version 2.5.

The version range `2.x` supports the new project layout as scaffolded by
`yo loopback`.

This document describes the configuration conventions of the `2.x` versions.

## Installation

    npm install loopback-boot

## Usage

```js
var loopback = require('loopback');
var boot = require('loopback-boot');

var app = loopback();
boot(app, __dirname);

app.listen();
```

See [API docs](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-boot/) for
